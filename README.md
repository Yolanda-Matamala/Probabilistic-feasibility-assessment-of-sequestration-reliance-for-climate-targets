This repository contains the supplemental material (model input and output files) related to the paper titled
"Probabilistic feasibility assessment of sequestration reliance for climate targets"
## Data description
### 1. Data emissions: 
This data contains the input emissions of the chance constraint considered in this study.
One of this article's "key steps" is to match the GCAM-LA emissions levels with the emissions levels calculated by the chance constraint for each likelihood level.
An example of this "key step" can be found in "step_by_step.xlsx"
### 2. step_by_step:
This file contains an example of how to calculate the chance constraint for one likelihood level of 95% (the first tab). The second tab of the file contains
the emissions levels calculated from GCAM which matches the emissions level results of the chance constraint in 95% likelihood level.
### 3. Data_Electricity: 
This file contains the output results from GCAM-LA about electricty subsector for every single likelihood level.
